# Auth0 Next.js SDK Sample Application

This sample demonstrates the integration of [Auth0 Next.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0) into a Next.js MFA DASHBOARD application created using [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). 


This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- [Login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L48-L54)
- [Logout](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/components/NavBar.jsx#L80-L82)
- [Showing the user profile](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/profile.jsx)
- [Protecting client-side rendered pages](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/profile.jsx#L42-L45)
- [Calling APIs](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-nextjs-samples/blob/main/Sample-01/pages/external.jsx)

- LOG IN with ROPG to obtain an mfa_token to query Auth0 MFA API
- LOG IN  with NEW UNIVERSAL LOGIN, with Auth0 MFA audience.
- Showing enrolled authenticators.
- Removing enrolled authenticators.
- Request an  MFA reset
- Enroll authenticator

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

### Create an API

For the **External API** page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API Identifier that you can use in the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` environment variable below. Then you will need to [add a permission](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/add-api-permissions) named `read:shows` to your API. To get your app to ask for that permission, include it in the value of the `AUTH0_SCOPE` environment variable.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_SCOPE` values in the next steps.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 Domain, Client ID and Client Secret for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `.env.local.example` into a new file in the same folder called `.env.local`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials (see more info about [loading environmental variables in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)):

```sh
# A long secret value used to encrypt the session cookie
AUTH0_SECRET='LONG_RANDOM_VALUE'
# The base url of your application
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
# The url of your Auth0 tenant domain
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL='https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN.auth0.com'
# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
# Your Auth0 application's Client Secret
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
# Your Auth0 API's Identifier 
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_AUDIENCE='YOUR_AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER'
# The permissions your app is asking for
# OMIT if you do not want to use the API part of the sample
AUTH0_SCOPE='openid profile email read:shows'
```

**Note**: Make sure you replace `AUTH0_SECRET` with your own secret (you can generate a suitable string using `openssl rand -hex 32` on the command line).

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the Next.js app and starts the API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker build

To build and run the Docker image, run `exec.sh`, or `exec.ps1` on Windows.

### Run the unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Run the integration tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```
